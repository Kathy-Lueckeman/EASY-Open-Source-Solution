# Enterprise Application Solution for Yield
This repo was set up for Maryville University's *Enterprise Application Solution for Yield*.

## Synopsis
*Enterprise Application Solution for Yield* (EASY) is a “builder,” which is designed to be a user tool so departments can control their own application. It’s an extension of Salesforce’s approach to “democratizing” software. That is, the same way that Salesforce democratized software by separating declarative functionality from coding, EASY democratizes declarative and user functionality, separating application and question/requirement setup from administrative setup of fields and picklist values. The latter most often are associated with IPEDS and/or SIS fields in global picklist sets, minimizing the initial and support work required by system administrators.

That means users control most of the functions of the solution rather than having to heavily rely on the IT department for updates to existing questions or new applications. The user tool approach, then, equates to empowerment for departments.

The solution includes an unmanaged package (the EASY Package), resource documents, and code via this GIT repository.

We welcome contributions and feedback. Read below for more information about how to get involved!

</a>

You can install EASY as-is into any Developer Edition, Sandbox, Enterprise, or higher edition org using these unmanaged package links and the <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/EASY-Open-Source-Solution/blob/master/Docs/Installation%20Guide%20-%20EASY.pdf" target="_blank">Installation Guide</a>:

* <a href="https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t2E000003ZR5Y" target="_blank">Install EASY in a Sandbox</a>
* <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t2E000003ZR5Y" target="_blank">Install EASY in a Production or Developer Org</a>

Alternatively, you can fork this repository and deploy the unmanaged version of the code into a Salesforce org of your choice.

* Fork the repository by clicking on the "Fork" button in the upper-righthand corner. This creates your own copy of EASY for your Github user.
* Clone your fork to your local machine via the command line
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/EASY-Open-Source-Solution.git
```
* You now have a local copy on your machine. EASY has some built-in scripts to make deploying to your Salesforce org easier. Utilizing ant and the Force.com Migration tool, you can push your local copy of EASY to the org of your choice. You'll need to provide a build.properties to tell ant where to deploy. An example file might look like:

```
sf.username = YOUR_ORG_USERNAME
sf.password = YOUR_ORG_PASSWORD
sf.serverurl = https://login.salesforce.com ##or test.salesforce.com for sandbox environments
sf.maxPoll = 20
```

* Now deploy to your org utilizing ant

```sh
$ cd EASY-Open-Source-Solution
$ ant deploy
```

## Interactions for Student Recruitment

EASY includes a modified version of University of Miami’s <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Interactions-for-Student-Recruitment" target="_blank">Interactions for Student Recruitment package</a>. Specifically, any references to HEDA objects in the codebase have been abstracted to first test for the existence of those objects before executing the code. Also, the Plan__c object has been renamed to Program__c in EASY. If you’re installing EASY after first installing/implementing Interactions for Student Recruitment, this may mean you need to migrate all Plan__c records over to the Program__c object.

Much more information, including the Documentation Guides that explain the use and benefit of Interactions for Student Recruitment, can be found on the Salesforce Foundation GIT Respository <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Interactions-for-Student-Recruitment" target="_blank">here</a>.
